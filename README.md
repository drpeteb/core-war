# core-war
Python implementation of A. K. Dewdney's "Core War"

This is an implementation of the basic form of Core War, as detailed in
the May 1984 edition of Scientific American (and reprinted as a chapter of
The Armchair Universe). As such, there is no SPL command.

The two starter programs, DWARF and IMP, and included.

Run battle.py to begin a core war.
